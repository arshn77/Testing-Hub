# Testing Center

View an application demo here: https://arshn77.pythonanywhere.com/

Testing Center is a test mangagment software, where both managers and engineers can view tests being ran, and details about the test such as it's progress, failure, start/end dates, etc.

You can also sort and filter the test table based on it's properties, or **click a single test** to look at it's details in a more readable way.

On the top right you can change the view of the table between Engineer, Manager, or Technician so that you can look at only the information that is necessary to you. Your view settings should persist if you leave or reload the page as they are saved in local storage
